# CustomerAnalytics-BestBuy

Based on the information we have found about the company and taking into consideration our target’s market demand for technology, we pose the following research question: how can a traditional brick and mortar store such as Best Buy survive the ever-growing era of e-commerce and remain competitive and popular to millenials? To help us answer our research question, we are focusing on the following strategy analyses: 

● Product Positioning Strategy Analysis: Analyzing Best Buy’s market sentiment against its competitors, thereby aiding customer satisfaction:
    ○ The rise in e-commerce has brought a significant increase in the importance of customer reviews. There are hundreds of review   sites and massive amounts of product reviews online. 
Marketing Research Project – Group 4 
    ○ The ability to successfully decide whether a review will be helpful to other customers and thus giving a product more exposure is vital to the company. 

● Price Strategy Analysis: This is an analysis of the traditional and online retailers compared to Best Buy, based on data found on a third party platform. 

Recommendations  
a) We realized that the majority of customers buy products in “new condition”, therefore in order to face the increasing competition; Best Buy needs to reinforce its positioning in this segment. 
b) The number of impressions is an approach for brand awareness. Therefore, it’s recommendable to analyze the reason behind the lower count of impressions for Best Buy in the last quarter—especially when Holiday season is approaching. This might be an effective way to bring the brand to customer’s attention. 
c) Sentiment analysis is an insightful tool for Best Buy as it allows us to gauge feedback about products and respond to complaints. With this information, we can take corrective actions such as improve customer service and inform the Research and Development team. 
d) Best Buy can also utilize online opinions to support shoppers in the product research and discovery stage. Such opinions can then be displayed on product pages and across the site, so these can be turned into actionable insights and recommendations. Shoppers can then find the answers according to their own specific needs. Thus, Sentiment Analysis helps empower Best Buy’s e-Commerce website. 
e) According to our Google Analytics findings, we noticed that people are searching for gaming consoles, so this can be an opportunity to attract and establish a stronger relationship with the gaming community. In addition, we can also see an opportunity due to the Coronavirus lockdown(COVID-19 IMPACTS) as more people are staying at home and are thinking about ways for entertainment. For example, the company could consider improving its discontinued Gamers Club Unlocked membership program. 
f) Based on Google analytics and number of views, Best Buy is not receiving much popularity in their YouTube channel, therefore, it needs improvements. Since Customers are interested in videos related to “How to…”, “Lab” and “Tips”, we could leverage the expertise that their associates have, so the platform is a site of exchange of knowledge, adding value to their customers and improving their positioning. 
g)We have to think about how the company is strategically using the video platform. If we look at Amazon’s site, their videos have a better layout than Best Buy as they only have one channel to feature. One suggestion would be to add online tutorials such as webinars, thus increasing brand loyalty against lower prices from other companies. 
h)Best Buy has had to adapt and make decisions as the Coronavirus pandemic has impacted the company in many levels:
● There are supply chain-related issues and complications throughout the flow of merchandise. 
● Best Buy furloughed about 51,000 hourly employees 
● The company’s stores are offering curbside pickup during the coronavirus pandemic, but they’ve been closed to customers since March 22. 
● During an eight-day period that ended March 20, its sales were up by about 25% as people bought freezers, computer monitors and other items to use for their stays at home during the pandemic. In recent weeks, however, Best Buy’s sales have dropped off. The company has seen more demand for some items, such as gaming devices, but has had a sales decline of 30% since March 21. 
● Online sales in the U.S. are up more than 250% and about half of those sales are picked up at its stores. 
● Best Buy’s shares are down 25% since the start of the year. 
● The company has taken other actions to rein in its budget during the pandemic, including suspending 401(k) matches, lowering capital spending and slashing marketing expenses. 
 
 
Conclusion 
As we can see, a traditional brick and mortar store can definitively survive in the era of ecommerce, and still stand against all odds. However, there is always room for improvement. We have found that researching and analyzing what customers have to say about prices and electronics, and their behavior online, can help Best Buy know exactly what areas of the business need more attention. 
 

Future Enhancements: 
 
● Currently part of the research was made using the third party datasource available, so in future we would like to obtain Best Buy’s product sale and customer reviews from company authorized data source and train our models with the same, which could help draw latest trends about the product. 
 
● To have a better User interface, and integrate it with the above described interactive application model for sentiment analysis.
